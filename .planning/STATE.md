# STATE.md -- GSD-Docs Industrial

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-02-14)

**Core value:** Engineers can create, manage, and review FDS/SDS projects through a visual web interface that guides them through the full document lifecycle
**Current focus:** Phase 9 - Reference Library & File Management

## Current Position

- Phase: 9 of 17 (Reference Library & File Management)
- Plan: 0 of 2 in current phase
- Status: Ready to plan
- Last activity: 2026-02-15 - Completed Phase 8 (Core Infrastructure)

## Progress

Progress: [████████░░░░░░░░░░░░] 47% (8 of 17 phases complete)

v1.0 milestone: 7 phases, 33 plans - Complete ✓
v2.0 milestone: 10 phases, 21 plans - Phase 8 complete

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity (v1.0):**
- Total plans completed: 33
- Total execution time: 8 days
- 89/89 requirements satisfied

**v2.0 (in progress):**
- Plans completed: 3 of 21
- Phase 8: 3/3 plans complete ✓
- Files created: 82
- Last completed: Phase 8 (Core Infrastructure)

## Accumulated Context

**From v1.0:**
- 14 `/doc:*` commands with proven workflow (discuss → plan → write → verify → review → assemble → export)
- Domain knowledge in 194 files: templates, section structures, verification criteria, prompt patterns
- SPECIFICATION.md v2.7.0 is SSOT for document generation logic
- 4 project types (A/B/C/D) with distinct workflow templates
- Typicals library (CATALOG.json) for SDS matching
- Bilingual Dutch/English support throughout

**v2.0 architecture:**
- FastAPI backend replaces Claude Code as orchestrator
- React frontend replaces terminal as UI
- Claude API (Anthropic SDK) for LLM access
- SQLite for project/file metadata
- VM deployment with Nginx + systemd

**Phase 8 deliverables (now available):**
- FastAPI backend: project CRUD, health check, LLM provider abstraction (LiteLLM)
- React frontend: dashboard with filters/search/sort, 3-step wizard, workspace
- Workspace: fixed sidebar + slide-in Sheet for assistant panel
- All UI in Dutch, dark/light theme with FOUC prevention
- Tailwind v4 with shadcn/ui components

## Decisions

See PROJECT.md Key Decisions table for full list.

Recent decisions affecting v2.0:
- **FastAPI + React stack**: Full control over UI, proper web architecture, model-agnostic
- **LLM provider abstraction**: Enables local model swap in v3.0
- **SQLite for metadata**: Lightweight, sufficient for 5-20 users
- **VM deployment**: No Docker per company policy
- **SQLite async with aiosqlite** (08-01): Async operations throughout, check_same_thread=False for compatibility
- **App starts without API key** (08-01): Development workflow before external service config
- **CORS origins localhost:5173** (08-01): Vite default port, configurable via env for production
- **Tailwind CSS v4 with @theme** (08-02): CSS-first configuration, cleaner than JS config
- **FOUC prevention inline script** (08-02): Apply dark class before React loads
- **Motion for spring animations** (08-02): Lightweight alternative to Framer Motion
- **Fixed sidebar + slide-in Sheet** (08-03): Replaces resizable panels — cleaner layout, no sizing constraints
- **All UI in Dutch** (08-03): Target engineering team preference, future phase adds language toggle
- **Type definitions from SPECIFICATION.md** (08-03): Domain-accurate A/B/C/D descriptions
